We are currently involved in a variety of projects covering aspects of malware, mobile systems, privacy, security, and cryptography, in particular, post-quantum cryptography and computation over encrypted data. 

We have a long tradition of collaborations with the industry, for instance, with projects together with Intel and Samsung. If you are interested in collaborating with us, please, reach us out!
